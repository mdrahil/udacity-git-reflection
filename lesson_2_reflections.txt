How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Working directory is the directory which contains the loacl git repository. 
A repository keep tracks changes of the files which are added to the repository in the working directory.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
At any given point of time I can compare the staging area with the last commit and make sure the logical changes are to be commited in the repo.
